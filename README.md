# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm ElGeroIngles!
Hello! I'm a Spanish teenager who really likes to code minecraft datapacks, python scripts and more!

# ðŸš€ Projects
Throughout some years of experience I've developed some things:
| Projects | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [<img src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XTJUiumo/4c0f0fe4e1deb7416bf53bc9b51ea59e541d9a4e.png" width="50" height="50">](https://modrinth.com/datapack/bft) | Better Fletching Tables is a minecraft datapack which tries to improve minecraft fletching tables which do nothing other than turning villagers into fletchers. |
| [<img src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/6h6n9XJ9/393d7ccbcafabf47016bea7d405811b6b54ae09a.png" width="50" height="50">](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tpa) | TPA is a datapack recreation of the popular TPA mod which lets you request a tp to other players. This datapack makes use of the macros added in 1.20.2 |
| [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElGeroIngles/wfc_mc/main/wfc%20(datapack)/pack.png" width="50" height="50">](https://github.com/ElGeroIngles/wfc_mc) | Wave Funcion Collapse is a datapack recreation of the popular [Wave Function Collapse algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse). This datapack is not a library (although it can be used as but not recommended), it is meant to be a proof of content that it's possible and an starting point of how it would be implemented. (This datapack was made before macros). |
| [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElGeroIngles/json-multiple-gradients/main/icon.png" width="50" height="50">](https://github.com/ElGeroIngles/json-multiple-gradients) | JSON multiple gradients is a python script forked from [rackodo](https://github.com/rackodo)'s [gradient JSON minecraft](https://github.com/rackodo/gradient-json-minecraft) repository which allows you to customize a minecraft JSON to add color gradients to it. |

There are more projects that I haven't talked about so if you are interested check them out in my [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/ElGeroIngles) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/ElGeroIngles?tab=repositories)!
